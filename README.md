## 🌟 Project Overview

**EMBER** is a single-page restaurant website designed with a cinematic, fire-inspired aesthetic. The project demonstrates advanced CSS 3D transformations, particle animation systems, and immersive UI/UX design — all without any external frameworks or libraries.

The restaurant concept centers around **wood-fire fine dining**, and every visual element — from the rotating orbit-ring 3D plate in the hero to the flickering candle on the chef's table — reinforces that theme.

## 🎯 Features

### 3D Visual Elements
- **Hero 3D Plate Scene** — A CSS `transform-style: preserve-3d` plate with three animated orbit rings and floating food ingredients rotating around it
- **Menu Card Food Models** — Each dish (Wagyu steak, salmon, pasta, salad, soup, dessert) is a uniquely sculpted CSS 3D object with realistic radial-gradient shading, specular highlights, and drop shadows
- **Chef's Table 3D Diorama** — A full animated dining table scene with a perspective-rotated table surface, dinner plate with food, a wine glass with liquid fill effect, and a flickering candle flame

### Animations & Effects
- 🔥 **Ember Particle System** — Continuously rising fire particles generated by JavaScript, with randomized delays, sizes, and amber/gold colors
- ✨ **Floating Sparkles** — Ambient gold sparkle elements on the 3D table scene
- 🌀 **Orbit Rings** — Three rotating rings at different speeds around the hero plate
- 🎯 **Custom Cursor** — Amber dot cursor with a lagging circular trail ring
- 📜 **Scroll Reveal** — IntersectionObserver-powered fade-in animations for all sections

### Functional UI
- 🗂️ **Tabbed Menu** — Three categories (Mains, Starters, Desserts) with smooth tab switching
- ➕ **Add to Order Buttons** — Animated confirmation on click (turns green with a ✓ checkmark)
- 📅 **Reservation Form** — Date, time, and guest count inputs with a confirmation message on submit
- 🧭 **Smooth Navigation** — Fixed header with scroll-linked nav links

### Design System
- **Color Palette** — Fire (`#FF4500`), Amber (`#FF8C00`), Gold (`#FFD700`), Charcoal (`#1A1108`)
- **Typography** — Playfair Display (display/headings) + Jost (body/UI)
- **Ambient Glow Orbs** — CSS-blurred fixed background orbs that drift with animation
- **Backdrop Blur Nav** — Frosted glass effect on the navigation bar

## 💡 Design Philosophy

> *"Bold, intentional, and unforgettable."*

The design commits fully to a **fire and luxury** aesthetic — every element from the radial gradient backgrounds to the ember particle system is purposefully crafted to evoke warmth, sophistication, and the primal allure of open flame cooking.

The 3D elements avoid generic design by using CSS `perspective`, `transform-style: preserve-3d`, and `rotateX/Y` transforms to create genuine depth — no canvas, no WebGL, no Three.js.
